To open the Markers window, move the cursor to the Gw2 Electaco menu at the top of the screen, and click on Markers in the popup

![Open marker window]({% link assets/images/markers/markers0.jpg %})

This will open the Markers window. The rest of the instructions will be focused on that window.

The four icons on the right of the marker window are:

1. Search for marker packs online
2. Create new marker pack
3. Import marker pack from file
4. Close window

## Creating marker pack

All markers belong to a marker pack, so the first step is to create a marker pack to have the markers in. 

To create a marker pack, click on the "New markerpack" icon in the Markers window:

![New marker pack]({% link assets/images/markers/markers1.jpg %})

This will create a new marker group

![New marker pack]({% link assets/images/markers/markers2.jpg %})

### Editing a marker pack

You can rename the marker group by moving the mouse over the text, and then click the Edit icon at the end of the text, 
and you can expand the marker group by clicking the + sign at the start of the line

![Edit marker pack]({% link assets/images/markers/markers3.jpg %})

The icons on the right side are : 

1. Toggle visibility
2. Create new marker
3. Change marker icon color
4. Delete marker group

Under the title you have description, which can be edited in the same way as the title, and on the right "Export marker group to file" icon.
